# YOLOv8 Training Configuration for Clemson Parking Dataset
# Usage: python scripts/train_parking_model.py --data configs/clemson_parking.yaml

# Dataset paths (relative to script location or absolute)
path: ../datasets/clemson_parking  # Dataset root directory
train: images/train                 # Train images (relative to 'path')
val: images/val                     # Validation images (relative to 'path')
test:                               # Test images (optional)

# Number of classes
nc: 1  # We only detect cars

# Class names
names:
  0: car

# Training notes:
# - Annotate cars from top-down view using bounding boxes
# - Use YOLO format: class_id x_center y_center width height (normalized 0-1)
# - Save .txt files in labels/train/ and labels/val/ with same names as images
# - Example annotation for a car:
#   0 0.5 0.5 0.15 0.25
#   (class 0, center at 50% x/y, width 15%, height 25% of image)

# Recommended augmentation settings for parking lot images:
# These are applied automatically by Ultralytics but can be customized:
# 
# augment:
#   hsv_h: 0.015     # HSV-Hue augmentation (fraction)
#   hsv_s: 0.7       # HSV-Saturation augmentation
#   hsv_v: 0.4       # HSV-Value augmentation  
#   degrees: 0.0     # Rotation (±degrees) - keep low for parking lots
#   translate: 0.1   # Translation (±fraction)
#   scale: 0.5       # Scale (±gain)
#   shear: 0.0       # Shear (±degrees)
#   perspective: 0.0 # Perspective (±fraction)
#   flipud: 0.0      # Flip up-down (probability) - usually not useful for parking
#   fliplr: 0.5      # Flip left-right (probability)
#   mosaic: 1.0      # Mosaic augmentation (probability)
#   mixup: 0.0       # MixUp augmentation (probability)
